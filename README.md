Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room wanted a game that would have multiple players on different teams try to identify a picture given just segments of it at a time. They wanted the software to be able to run on multiple platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did weel with my recomendations. Being able to give good recommendations to the client as to what type of software and hardware they need it crual to providing a good product.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a flow chart was helpful. Being able to visually see how each attribute connects between different classes was nice when it came time to looking over the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would try to be more specific with the executive summary as well as design constraints. I would have added they also want it to be able to run on not only your tipical computer browers but also on mobile devices as well. Being able to think ahead on the game needed to also work on mobile can be a big change as well as constrain when it comes to design due to the difference in hardware.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Being able to run on multiple different operating systesm. You have to write some specific code for each different platform but they can still use the same server code.
Being able to give the client what they want is a big part in somfeware design. If the client isnt happy with the product then it looks bad on you as a developer.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
There was alot of reaserch that went into figuring out how ot properly do a certain task in the code. I have been coding for the better part of 2 years now with my classes. but I have a long way to go. research is always a good way to start becuase there is pleanty of resources online to help figure out any thing you might need.
